DESCRIPTION: A **Real-Time Chat Application** is a web-based communication system that enables users to send and receive messages instantly over the internet without any delay or page refresh. The application is developed using **HTML** to create the structure of the chat interface, **CSS** to design and style the layout for a clean and responsive user experience, and **JavaScript** to handle real-time message processing, user interactions, and dynamic content updates. Real-time communication is achieved by maintaining a continuous connection between users, allowing messages to be transmitted and displayed immediately when sent. Each message can include sender details and timestamps, making conversations clear and organized. The application supports multiple users and works efficiently across different devices and screen sizes. Real-time chat applications are commonly used in customer support systems, social media platforms, online learning environments, and collaborative workspaces. Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of front-end web technologies to build a fast, interactive, and user-friendly real-time communication system.
